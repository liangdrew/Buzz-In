BUZZ IN - MAKEY MAKEY BREADBOARD QUIZ MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE 
===============================================

https://github.com/liangdrew/makeymakey-buzzers/
===============================================

Buzz In uses Python and Pygame to allow a game master to manage 
team-based quizzes in which buzzers are used (hardware simulated using Makey Makey
breadboard and accompanying wiring http://makeymakey.com). 

INSTRUCTIONS
============

Press the 'Y' key if the answer provided is correct upon "buzzing in".
Press the 'N' key if the answer provided is incorrect upon "buzzing in".
Press the 'P' key to display game statistics.
Pree the 'ESC' key to exit the program.

HOW TO USE
==========

Each key corresponds to a team colour (red, blue, green, yellow, black). 
The first team that "buzzes in" by closing their circuit will have their team colour show up on the program window and a recorded voice-over played which calls out their team colour. 
Teams will not be able to buzz-in again until the game master presses the 'Y' key or the 'N' key, meaning that the team has answered, respectively, correctly or incorrectly. 
If correct, the team will gain 1 point. 
If incorrect, the other teams may buzz-in to answer the same question, but the team which answered incorrectly will not be able to buzz-in again until the question provided by the game master is answered correctly by a different team.
